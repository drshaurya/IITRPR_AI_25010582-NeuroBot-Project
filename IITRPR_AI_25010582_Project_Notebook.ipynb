        "Data used for developing this project was synthetically generated using ChatGPT 5.2. The chatbot was initially prompted to generate a dataset of 50 multiple-choice questions from the field of neurology (more specifically, neuroanatomy and its clinical aspects). These questions were accompanied by answers and short explanations about the answers. ChatGPT was told to ensure that the difficulty level of questions was equally distributed between easy, moderate and hard. The data was then expanded to 200 questions, with the condition that the content must include all aspects of neurology in comparable quantity. The final dataset used was in the form of a .csv file, which included columns for question; options a, b, c and d; correct option; topic; difficulty; and explanation."

The dataset that I have used to build it currently, has been synthetically generated by ChatGPT and is also a small dataset of 200 questions with answers and explanations. The scope of this project is currently limited only to Neurology but can be expanded to include other specialties of medicine. There are no concerns about the ethical implications of the tool as it does not require any personal data from the user, and the model design does not inherently predispose to bias."
